#UNETR, or UNet Transformer, is a Transformer-based architecture for medical image segmentation 
# that utilizes a pure transformer as the encoder to learn sequence representations of the input volume -- 
# effectively capturing the global multi-scale information. 
# The transformer encoder is directly connected to a decoder via 
# skip connections at different resolutions like a U-Net to compute the final semantic segmentation output.


#UNETR, or UNet Transformer, is a specialized architecture for medical image segmentation. 
#It uses a pure transformer as the encoder, focusing on learning sequence representations for 
#the input volume to capture global multi-scale information. 
#The encoder connects directly to a decoder through skip connections, 
#forming a U-Net-like structure and producing the ultimate semantic segmentation output.


# Dataset named "Lapa": 
#LaPa stands for Landmark guided face Parsing dataset (LaPa). 
# It is a large-scale dataset for human face parsing. 
# It consists of more than 22,000 facial images with abundant variations in expression, 
# pose and occlusion, 
# and each image of LaPa is provided with a 11-category pixel-level label map and 106-point landmarks.
    


#Look at the lapa_1.png and lapa_2.png as examples of the dataset
